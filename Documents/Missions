Mission 1: (Single Player)
          Flash back after Miles wakes up. Australian War 2025. Big city, burning, debris.
          The team jumps from a window to an overpass, but Jimmy doesn’t make the jump. Miles runs to the edge of the bridge to try to catch Jimmy, but he can’t. He gets shot and climbs into the rear driver’s side seat of a jeep to leave. As jeep door closes shot changes to Miles’ truck door closing and he drives away.
         Background: A double agent within the Pentagon leaks information to the RSA from America's security files using the attack as a distraction.  He is eventually caught and interrogated. He explains that he leaked a large packet of files describing weapon plans and theories.  Unknown to the player and the agent, The RSA finds tsunami missile plans. (Show this as a narrated cutscene by Watchdog)
          As he drives down the highway, shot gradually increases speed on switch between his truck and a close up of the missile on a drone. Missile fires from drone and is seen hitting Pentagon. Miles is shocked, drives a little further and then another missile hits the bridge in front of him. He crashes and the screen goes black, but explosions can still be heard.
          First Person POV as Miles opens his eyes inside of an Ambulance.
