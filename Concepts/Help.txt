Concepts

Preliminary Sketches
 -Single pencil-sketched views such as a side view of a 
particular asset that must be discussed and approved by both of us before
being fully sketched.
-Must have overall dimensions and be proportional. (graph paper, if possible)

Full Sketches
-At this point, all views should be sketched on paper in pencil and put into
a single folder named after the asset.  
-Each image view within the folder should be named as follows: 
AssetName_Left, AssetName_Front, AssetName_Perspective, etc.
-These views will be discussed as a whole together and, if approved, ready for Color.

Colored Sketches
-All the views within the asset's folder should be imported to a digital drawing 
software such as Sketchbook to be set up using the layer system stated in 
the Design Pipeline and given a color scheme discussed by the both of us.
-Separate images may be necessary depending on the scale of the asset and 
the level of detail that needs to be preserved.
***Keep the proportions equal across all images to provide easier modeling***
-If approved, it is ready for a grey-box in Blender
